        <p class="h2">What is alopecia areata?</p>
        <p>Alopecia areata is a condition that causes your hair to fall out in patches. These patches may connect and
            then become more noticeable. The condition develops when your immune system attacks the hair follicles
            causing hair loss. </p>
        <p>This kind of hair loss is very common, affecting nearly 7 million people in the
            United States, according to the National Alopecia Areata Foundation (NAAF). It can affect people of
            any ethnicity, sex, or age. Alopecia areata may begin in childhood or adulthood. It is also different for
            each person.</p>

                <div>Hair loss: Common causes
                    and treatment</div>
            </h2>
            <p>
                <meta charset="utf-8">Alopecia areata may occur on your scalp and in some cases, your eyebrows,
                eyelashes, and face, as well as other parts of your body. It can also develop slowly and recur after
                years between instances.<br>
            </p>
            <p>When hair loss involves all the hair on your body, the condition is called alopecia universalis. When
                your hair does grow back, it’s possible you might experience hair loss again. The extent of hair loss
                and regrowth varies from person to person.</p>
            <p>There’s currently no cure for alopecia areata, but there are positive things you can keep in mind about
                the condition and your outlook. </p>
            <p>According to the National Alopecia Areata Foundation, this kind of hair loss does not always become a
                lifelong condition. The hair follicles themselves are alive, so hair can often be regrown.</p>
            <p>There are also treatments that may help your hair grow back more quickly and that can prevent future hair
                loss, as well as unique ways to cover up the hair loss. Resources are also available to help you cope
                with stress that can be related to hair loss.</p>

                of an alopecia areata diagnosis for various races, with white people as the comparison group, are as
                follows:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>1.77 for African Americans</li>

            </h2>
            <p>There’s no known cure for alopecia areata, but there are treatments that you can try that might
                be able to slow down future hair loss or help hair grow back more quickly.</p>
            <p>The condition is difficult to predict, which means it may require a large amount of trial and error until
                you find something that works for you. It’s also important to remember that treatment isn’t always
                successful. Some people may continue to have hair loss, even with treatment.</p>
            <h3>Medical treatments</h3>
            <h4>Topical agents</h4>
            <p>You can rub medications into your scalp to help stimulate hair growth. A number of medications are
                available, both over the counter (OTC) and by prescription:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Minoxidil (<span style="font-size: 0px; line-height: 0;"></span>Rogaine) has OTC availability, and
                    while it’s
                    commonly used, it is not FDA approved for alopecia areata. Before applying it to areas such as the
                    scalp, eyebrows, and beard, you should speak with a healthcare professional. There’s only evidence
                    that it’s useful for people with <hl-trusted-source source="PubMed Central"
                        rationale="Highly respected database from the National Institutes of Health"
                        class="css-12hs4c5">limited alopecia areata<span
                            class="css-1mdvjzu icon-hl-trusted-source-after"><span class="sro">Trusted
                                Source</span></span><span></span></hl-trusted-source>. It generally takes about
                    4–6 months, or longer, to see results. </li>
                <li>Anthralin (Dritho-Scalp) is a drug that irritates the skin to spur hair regrowth.</li>
                <li>Corticosteroid creams such as clobetasol (Impoyz), foams, lotions, and
                    ointments are thought to work by decreasing inflammation in the hair follicle.</li>
                <li>Topical immunotherapy is a technique in which a chemical like diphencyprone is applied to the skin
                    to spark an allergic rash. The rash, which resembles poison oak, may induce new hair growth within 6
                    months. However, though repeat treatment may be necessary, it isn’t ordinarily done indefinitely.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Injections</h4>
            <p>Steroid injections are a common option for mild, patchy alopecia to help hair grow back on bald spots.
                Tiny needles inject the steroid into the bald area.</p>
            <p>The treatment has to be repeated every 1 to 2 months to regrow hair. It does not prevent new hair loss
                from occurring.</p>
            <h4>Oral treatments</h4>
            <p>Cortisone tablets are
                sometimes used for extensive alopecia, but due to the possibility of side effects, you should discuss
                this option with a doctor.</p>
            <p>Oral immunosuppressants,
                like methotrexate and cyclosporine, are another option you can try. They work by blocking the immune
                system’s response, but they cannot be used for a long period of time due to the risk of side effects,
                such as high blood
                pressure, liver and kidney
                damage, and an increased risk of serious infections and a type of cancer called lymphoma.</p>
            <h4>Laser and Light therapy</h4>
            <p>Light therapy is also called photochemotherapy, which uses a light sensitizer, or phototherapy, which
                uses specific wavelengths of ultraviolet light for their healing effects. Laser treatment delivers
                specific doses of radiation to encourage new hair growth. Both therapies are considered

            </p>
            <h4>Natural treatment</h4>
            <p>Some people with alopecia areata choose alternative therapies to treat the condition. However, it’s
                important to know that these are all experimental. They have not been tested in clinical trials, and
                there is no solid medical or scientific
                evidence to show that they’re effective. </p>
            <p>Natural and alternative treatments include acupuncture, aromatherapy, vitamins and supplements (including
                zinc and biotin), essential oils and other oils (such as coconut, tea tree, and castor oil), onion juice
                rubbed onto the scalp, and probiotics. </p>

            <p>Some individuals with a diagnosed autoimmune condition may consider following an anti-inflammatory diet.
                This type of eating plan is designed to help reduce the body’s autoimmune response and the chances of
                another hair loss episode or further hair loss.</p>
            <p>On this diet, you eat foods that are known to ease the inflammation process. The foundational foods of
                this diet, also known as the autoimmune protocol, are fruits and vegetables like blueberries, nuts,
                seeds, broccoli, beets, and lean meats like wild-caught salmon. </p>

            <p>The effectiveness of each treatment will vary from person to person. Some people won’t need treatment
                because their hair grows back on its own. However, in other cases, people won’t see improvement despite
                potentially trying every treatment option.</p>
            <p>You might need to try more than one treatment to see a difference. Keep in mind that hair regrowth may
                only be temporary. It’s possible for the hair to grow back and then fall out again.</p>

            <h2>
                <div> Causes of alopecia areata</div>
            </h2>
            <p>Alopecia areata is an autoimmune condition. An autoimmune
                condition develops when the immune system mistakes healthy cells for foreign substances. Normally, the
                immune system defends your body against foreign invaders, such as viruses and bacteria.</p>
            <p>However, if you have alopecia areata, your immune system mistakenly attacks your hair follicles. Hair
                follicles are the structures from which hairs grow. When the follicles become smaller and stop producing
                hair, it leads to hair loss.</p>
            <p>Researchers don’t know the exact cause of this condition. Some possible risk factors have been
                identified, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>genetics,</strong> such as a close family member with alopecia areata</li>
                <li><strong>having certain health conditions,</strong> such as Down’s Syndrome, thyroid disease, or
                    vitiligo</li>
                <li><strong>vitamin D deficiency</strong></li>
            </ul>
            <p>There is also a condition known as nivolumab-induced alopecia areata. This occurs in people who are being
                treated with the cancer drug nivolumab. In these cases, hair loss is a sign that the drug is working.

            <h2>
                <div> Symptoms of alopecia areata</div>
            </h2>
            <p>The main symptom of alopecia areata is hair loss. Hair usually falls out in patches on the scalp. These
                patches are often several centimeters or less.</p>
            <p>Hair loss might also occur on other parts of the face, like the eyebrows, eyelashes, and beard, as well
                as other parts of the body. Some people lose hair in a few places. Others lose it in multiple spots.</p>
            <p>You may first notice clumps of hair on your pillow or in the shower. If the spots are on the back of your
                head, someone may bring it to your attention. However, other health conditions can also cause hair to
                fall out in a similar pattern. Hair loss alone is not used to diagnose alopecia areata.</p>
            <p>In rare cases, some people may experience more extensive hair loss. This is usually an indication of
                another type of alopecia, such as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>alopecia totalis, which is
                    the loss of all hair on the scalp</li>
                <li>alopecia universalis, which is the
                    loss of all hair on the entire body</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Doctors might avoid using the terms “totalis” and “universalis” because some people may experience a
                degree of hair loss between the two conditions. For example, it’s possible to lose all hair on the arms,
                legs, and scalp, but not on the chest.</p>
            <p>The hair loss associated with alopecia areata is unpredictable, and as far as doctors and researchers can
                tell, it appears to be <hl-trusted-source source="BMJ"
                    rationale="Highly respected journal,Expert written journal,Peer reviewed journal"

                time and then may fall out again. The extent of hair loss and regrowth varies greatly from person to
                person.</p>
